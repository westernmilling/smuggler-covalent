=================

What is this?
-------------

Smuggle-Covalent is a Rails based application for translating purchase orders from [CovalentWorks](http://www.covalentworks.com/).

We use this to translate customer purchase orders into a form that is compatible with our other systems, including but not limited to our ERP.

Why is this open source?
------------------------

This is our contribution back to the community for using some of the great Ruby and Rails libraries out there. We also hope that this provides you with a demonstration of the development practices that we have decided to be a good fit for enterprise application development using Ruby and Rails.
